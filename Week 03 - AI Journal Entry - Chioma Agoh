AI Usage Journal
Chioma Agoh
Section 0302

This week I used AI to help during the exercies when figuring out where I was going wrong since I had more errors this time around compared to week 1 and 2.
To be honest I was having so much trouble that I had to rely on the AI assistance on Jupyter but as I was going on I realized that the prompts were very similar so 
I ended up understanding on my own by the middle half. Next time I will try and view the excercise fully and try to skim throuh so I can as the TA's for assistance during
wednesday's discussion.
