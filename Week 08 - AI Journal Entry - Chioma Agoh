This week I used AI on more exercies than the pervious ones. This weeks exercises were very tricky. For example, I did not know what was meant by a hierarchy in problem 14 and 
neither did Jupyters AI Assistant sho I used ChatGPT for help on that. Other than that I did use Jupyters assistant for syntax errors which I had a lot of in almost all of the 
problems. Both helped me run the code and set me up for what I need to look out for in the future.
