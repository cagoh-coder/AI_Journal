This weeks exercies were pretty repetative in nature so it was very easy for me to grasp the concepts. I will say I struggled a bit in the beginning which I did use ChatGPT for to help explain the prompts further. However, 
it is not the best in uncovering syntax errors. As a result I ended up having some codes that still have errors no matter what I changed based off of ChatGPT helping with the original code. I did not use Jupyters AI Assistant
this time because I wanted to try a different AI tool as a primary helper.
