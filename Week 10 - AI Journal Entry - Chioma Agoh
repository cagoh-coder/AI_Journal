This weeks exercises were easy as they were repeating concepts that were similar to each question. However there were some times that I was stuck in my code. For example, on exericse 7 I kept geeting errors so I asked 
jupyters AI assistant foe help and it led me to put the method inside the catalog class as it was outside everytime I ran the code. There were other instances where I used help but that was mostly for sytax and indentation 
errors.
