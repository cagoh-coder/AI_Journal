This weeks exercises was a little bit trickier than the previous exercises. I found myself needeing to use 
the Jupyter's AI Assistant quite a lot in the beginning problems for guidence as shown through the lines with 
(""") before and after a sentence. This helped me gain direction and minimize the mistakes i made in the 
other exercies. There were also some indentation errors that I ran into even though it was showing the blue 
line on the left. I cross referenced those on ChatGPT to see where the problem was with the indentation. For
some I was unable to fix the problem as it looked the same on both Juypter's AI Assistant and ChatGPT.
