This week I used the Jupyter AI assistant to help with the syntax errors that I was comming across. For example, the line "sn.notify("Book due tomorrow")" was giving me trouble 
wehn I tired to run it. I asked the AI assistant what I should do and it redirected me to replace "sn" with "notifier". Other than that these exercies were pretty easy and I got 
the gist of the assignemnt as a whole.
