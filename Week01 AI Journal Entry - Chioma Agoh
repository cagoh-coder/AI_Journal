Week 1
For this weeks assignement I used AI during a few of the questions as a refresher because there were errors in the syntax that I could not figure out myself. My AI chats should be added on the line with my code since I did 
use Anaconda Assistance chatbox but I am still not that used to using that feature on Anaconda. 
My project team did not use AI for our project at this stage, however I do think that we will use it as assistance at some point in the future which we will let that be known.
